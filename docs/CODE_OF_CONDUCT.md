# Code of Conduct

> If you are professional and polite, then everything will be alright.
> Please don't be inconsiderate and mean, or anything in between.

We do not have a formal code of conduct. That being said, we do not tolerate
harassment and will take action against any individual who is not acting
professionally. This can range from reprimanding them privately to blocking them
from interacting with the repository.
